 📌 Features

- Detects healthy vs diseased leaves of common crops
- Trained on the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Image preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- Web interface for uploading images and viewing predictions
- Flask API for backend integration
- Easy to extend for more crops or mobile support
